### Short professional biography
Seth Arens has worked as a research scientist for Western Water Assessment since 2015. At WWA, Seth works with resource managers, agencies and different levels of government in Utah to help the state understand, prepare for and adapt to changes in climate. Since 2019, Seth has been working to understand how ecosystems are re-establishing in locations once flooded by Lake Powell. Seth has a diverse background in science, including research experience in ecosystem and plant physiological ecology, snow hydrology and atmospheric science. From 2010-2015, he worked as an environmental scientist for the Utah Division of Air Quality, where he developed a research program to assess the extent and causes of ozone pollution in Utah. Prior to working in Utah, Seth studied impacts of climate change on ecosystems and carbon cycling in the Alaskan and Greenland Arctic. Seth earned a BA in Biology and Environmental Policy from Colby College in Maine and Masterâ€™s degrees in biology from the University of Alaska and the University of Utah. In his free time, Seth enjoys rafting western rivers and backcountry skiing in the Wasatch and Teton Mountains with his wife, son, duaghter and dog, Daisy.
### Earth Science Data Analytics course
* I am excited to learn how to code in Python and manage projkects with Github in order to work on large ecological and climate datasets.
* I would like to use skills acquired in this class to work with climate model data and to analyze ecological data collected from a project assessing how ecosystems are re-establishing on landscapes that were once underwater in the Lake Powell region.
